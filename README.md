# AND101 Project 6 - Superhero 2.0!!

Submitted by: **Carlos Cabrera**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Superhero Bio** is an android app that displays a list of characters in a RecycleView() layout (all universes) from the [SuperHero](https://superheroapi.com/) API.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü¶áü¶áü¶áüí•ü§õ**

## Notes

Needless to say, I'm a big superheroes fan. Although I'm team DC all the way, this app displays characters from all universes. Yes, even Marvel. The few (maybe too many) DC posts in my room inspired me to make my app superhero based.
It was a fun experience getting to read a lot of the API and RecycleView documentation(Big Headache üò≠) and learn how to actually use it on my app, and also going back and forth and spending most of my time trying to fix my bugs.
Note: The Random class is still goated üêêüíØ
