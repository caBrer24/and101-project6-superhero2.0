# AND101 Project 6 - INCOMING!!

Submitted by: **Carlos Cabrera**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Superhero Bio** is an android app that displays a random character (all universes) from the [SuperHero](https://superheroapi.com/) API.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü¶áü¶áü¶áüí•ü§õ**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **[SuperHero](https://superheroapi.com/) API**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

Needless to say, I'm a big superheroes fan. Although I'm team DC all the way, this app displays characters from all universes. Yes, even Marvel. The few (maybe too many) DC posts in my room inspired me to make my app superhero based.
It was a fun experience getting to read a lot of the API documentation and learn how to actually use it on my app, and also going back and forth trying to fix my errors.
Note: The Random class is goated üêêüíØ
